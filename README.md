## repo-template
The purpose of this project is to provide  a template for new open source repositories.

This repository contains some example best practices for open source repositories, including [LICENSE](LICENSE) file, boilerplate [README.md](README.md),  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) files. These may be copied into a new or existing project to make it easier for developers not on a project team to collaborate.

**NOTE: While this boilerplate project uses the Apache 2.0 license, when
establishing a new repo using this template, please use the
license that was approved for your project.**

**NOTE: This repository has been configured with the DCO bot. When you set up
a new repository that uses the Apache license, you should use the DCO to manage
contributions. The DCO bot will help enforce that. Please contact one of the
IBM GH Org stewards.**
